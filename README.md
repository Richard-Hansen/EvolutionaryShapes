# EvolutionaryShapes

This project uses a physics-based simulation to demonstrate the genetic algorithm. An initial population of shapes is created of varying sizes and vertices, these shapes are then dropped onto an 'obstacle' course, earning more points the further they go before they stop moving.

The best performing members of the population have their features combined and averaged to create a new population member, whilst the lowest performing member is removed. This can be repeated indefinitely.
